      <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
      <p>Hi, my name’s Aniket, and I’m a full-time MS in CS graduate student at George Mason University. I also have two
        years of experience solving real-world problems by developing softwares.
        I enjoy writing clean codes that are quick and easy to debug while also giving end users an enjoyable
        experience. I have worked with various languages and frameworks, and I am always looking for opportunities to
        work with something new. I currently have the most experience working with Python, DotNet Core, C#, Java, git,
        and AWS services.
        I am most skilled in Software Development and Watching Movies.

      <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right">George Mason University</span>Graduate Research Assistant</p>
      <p>Developing a uniform identity and cryptographic system that enhances security for the Internet of Things
        devices and cyber-physical systems that service large buildings. Writing entirety of source code and test
        modules while reading relevant papers and conferring with faculty experts to ensure the software is well
        designed.</p>
      <p>I am working on this project under <a href="https://volgenau.gmu.edu/profiles/dwijesek">Dr. Duminda
          Wijesekera</a> and <a href="https://business.gmu.edu/facultyandresearch/faculty/profile/115/170/">Dr. Nirup
          Menon</a>. The project has received funding from the <a href="https://www.virginiaipc.org">Virginia Innovation
          Partnership Authority</a> under <a href="https://cyberinitiative.org">Commonwealth Cyber Initiative</a> for
        the project: “5G Multi-Access Mobile Edge Server Based Security and Learning for Smart Building.”</p>
      <p>Modern buildings strive to enhance resilience and meet environmental goals such as net-zero energy and carbon
        emissions. Existing building systems use disparate networks, e.g., BACnet, LonTalk, ZigBee, Bluetooth, WIFI, IP
        to connect with HVAC, elevators, lighting, and physical security systems. These independently controlled systems
        use proprietary protocols and cloud-based services. Two major cybersecurity problems that arise from this are
        the lack of overall security governance localized to the building operators’ infrastructure and the inability to
        communicate between systems securely. Consequently, this affects the ability to optimize the cyber-physical
        security posture and energy usage by opening a uniform, secure platform to incorporate newer technologies such
        as solar rooftops and vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle charging based on price fluctuations during the time
        of day.</p><br>

      <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right">JP Morgan Chase & Co</span> Software Engineer</p>
      <p>Every company needs its softwares appropriately crafted, and JP Morgan Chase is no exception. Developing
        softwares that is clean, optimized, follows coding best practices is hard, and I played my part in making sure
        the whole world banking problem is not a problem anymore.</p>
      <p>I worked here as a part of a scrum team consisting of 4 Developers, 1 Tester, and a PO/BA. I spent most of my
        time working on a specific area of an extensive application that our team takes ownership over. The front end is
        an Angular app that talks to multiple APIs built using a collection of DotNet Core microservices. I spent time
        working in numerous parts of the stack, including creating APIs, integrating microservices, deploying code, and
        following best practices in a microservice.</p>
      <p>Recently we took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. We, as a team, worked together
        with the architects and designers to create something that would be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for
        years to come. We then built this to a high standard leading to a seamless switch over from the previous system
        with no issues.</p>
      <p>At JPMC, I gained experience working with a continuous integration workflow using tools such as Jenkins, image
        hosting using Docker, microservice orchestration through Kubernetes, and working with Amazon Web Services for
        deployments. We built most of our software using stack C#, DotNet Core, Cassandra, GraphQL, and Redis.</p>
      <p>For 12 months, I was working on delivering a standalone Identity and Access Management + Profile application
        that services all our user base. I also gained a lot of experience with Elasticsearch while working on Kibana to
        provide search functionality for logging. During the project, I spent hours communicating with the onshore team,
        performing deployments, and giving support.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of my time at JPMC, my role involved assisting with the company’s DevOps, including managing
        our AWS infrastructure and deploying and migrating data. I also spent time configuring and maintaining our
        applications SSO. This mainly involves configuring new applications and clients who are using ADFS, SAML, Client
        Credentials and also maintaining our softwares SSO functionality.</p>
      <p>I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a knowledge seeker within my team and
        the other teams in the office. I am always looking to gain improvements and challenge what and how we are
        working to deliver the best service to the customers while also developing to the highest standard products.</p>

              Credentials, Authorize Code with PKCE, and Refresh Token flow. Created a serverless AWS Lambda, which
              triggered every day to report users data on a daily basis for analytics purposes. Used AWS managed Kafka
              for data streaming. In addition, I also performed threat modeling and supported the penetration testing
              team. Made sure the penetration testing issues are immediately fixed to secure before its production
